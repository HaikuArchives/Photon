Photon 0.5.2 alpha

This is a painting program that is trying to join all basic features of Painter, Photoshop and Amiga's Deluxe Paint (no animation however). Itt has support for wacom tablet's pressure. Layers, Drawing, masking, filtering and all that.... See by yourself.

This is the abandoned BeUnited.org project, Photon. A BeUnited team started working on it, but the team decided to work on a completely new codebase, named Inferno. So, here we are, releasing Photon on BeBits some months later, as no one works on it anymore. The source code is available as well as the binary. If you would like to continue developing it, just visit http://photon.sourceforge.net and contact John Yanarella to give you the latest source and the passwords of the web site. The version that is included here, is a cleaned up version (over the original) from John Yanarella (Thanks John!).
To successfully run or compile Photon, please copy the two files found on [photon dir]/lib on the /home/config/lib/ folder.
The following message is from the original author of Photon, Santiago Lema.

Painting program for the BeOS.
by Santiago (=Jacques) Lema  (santiago.lema@cryogen.ch)

Requirements:
Pentium 200 looks OK but more certainly won't hurt.
BeOS R4.5 (no it won't work with r4.0, you need to get the update)

Special Libraries required: 
libimagemanip.so
libthumbnail.so

at least 32 Mb of RAM, more depending on Undo amount, image size and 3D rendering software in the background....

Known Bugs/Problems:
- Colorize mode acts just like normal mode.
- rather unstable at this point,to say the least.
- paper disabled
- you should _ALWAYS_ have at least one brush and one paper or it will crash
- tends to crash randomly when images are too big (over 1024x768)
- doesn't check if enought memory is available when loading pic... 


ToDo:
- Too much to list now.

Legal issues 
(This is only in case you're American and would sue your own mother :-):
THIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED WITHOUT ANY GUARANTEE. ALTHOUGH I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING FOR IT TO DO SO. IT COULD AS WELL, DAMAGE YOUR DATA, INSTALL WINDOWS 2000 WITH NO UNINSTALL OPTION, CAUSE A RECTAL EXPLOSION OR ANYTHING BAD. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.

But mainly, it is just a crappy painting program.
